Regexp or regex expressions: 
(used in any language Java, Javascript, php, Perl and Python)
(regular expressions)(https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html#zz-1.)

It's powerful in searching and manipulating text strings, particularly in processing text files. one of this lines can replace several lines of programming codes.

Syntax Summary: 

     Character: All characters matches themselves. 
               regex x matches substring "x"
               regex 9 matches "9"
               regex = matches "="
               regex @ matches "@"

     Special Regex Characters: theses have special meaning in regex.
     ., +, *,?,^, $, (,), [,], {,}, |, \.

    Escape Sequences (\char): To match a character having a special meaning in regex, you need to use a escape sequence prefix with a backslash (\)
               \. matches "."
               \+ matches "+"
               \( matches "("
               \\ matches "\"
          regex recognizes common escape sequences 
               \n for newline
               \t for tab
               \r for carriage-return
               \nnn for a up to 3 digit octal number ***
               \xhh for a two digit hex code
               \uhhhh for a 4-digit unicode
               \uhhhhhhhh for a 8-digit unicode. 

***The octal numeral system, or oct for short, is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7.   

    A sequence of Characters (or String): Strings can be matched via combining a sequence of characters (called sub-expressions) 
                Saturday matches "Saturday"
        
        it is case-sensitive, so we can set to case-sensitive via modifier 

    OR operator (|) 
                four | 4 accepts 4 or "four"
    Character class (or Bracket List):
            [...]: Accept ANY ONE of the character within the squeare
                [aeiou] matches "a", "e", "i", "o", "u".
                
            [.-.] (Range Expression): accept ANY ONE of the character in the range, 
                [0-9] matches any digit 
                [A-Za-Z] matches any uppercase o lowercase letters.
            
            [^...] NOT ONE of the character
                [^0-9] matches any non-digit.
            
            Only these four characters require escape sequence inside the bracket list: ^, -,],\
